- @kaapi/server: `auth: true` should not set up startegy but only `mode: 'required'`. Strategy should be explicitly defined. @done

- @kaapi/kaapi
    - create some auth designs:
        - basic auth (to create from scratch)
        - bearer (take it from the examples/auth-designs/src/plugins/apiKeyDesign.ts)
        - apikey (take it from the examples/auth-designs/src/plugins/bearerDesign.ts)

- @kaapi/oauth2-auth-design
    - check out token type DPoP (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession)


- @kaapi/kaapi
    - make an example with @novice1/socket
    - need to think more about how we are going to handle readiness (registering plugins, strategies, ...)

- @kaapi/cli
    - auth design generator (name of the class, camelCase it)
