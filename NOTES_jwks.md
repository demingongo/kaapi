**key rotation for JWKS** (JSON Web Key Sets) is critical for maintaining long-term security of your JWT infrastructure, but it needs to be balanced against availability and operational complexity.

## ✅ Best Practices for JWKS Key Rotation

### 🔄 **1. Rotate keys every 3–6 months**

* **Recommended frequency**: Every **90–180 days**.
* This balances security (in case of key compromise) with operational stability.

> ☑️ Large security-conscious organizations (Google, AWS, Azure) tend to rotate keys every **3 to 6 months**.

---

### 🔐 **2. Always use key IDs (`kid`)**

* Ensure each key in your JWKS has a unique `"kid"` (key ID).
* JWTs should include this `kid` so consumers can pick the correct key during verification.

```json
{
  "kid": "key-2025-09-01",
  "kty": "RSA",
  "use": "sig",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "n": "...",
  "e": "..."
}
```

### 🧠 **3. Implement a grace period**

* When rotating keys, **don’t immediately remove the old key**.
* Keep both the **new and old keys** in the JWKS endpoint for a **grace period** (e.g., **7–14 days**).
* This ensures existing JWTs signed with the old key can still be verified.

---

### 🚨 **4. Automate rotation**

* Use tools or scripts to:

  * Generate new keys
  * Promote a key to "current"
  * Mark old keys as "retiring"
  * Remove retired keys after the grace period

---

### 💡 **5. Monitor token validation failures**

* Add observability (logging, alerts) around:

  * Missing `kid`
  * No matching key in JWKS
  * Signature verification failures
* This helps catch issues during or after rotation.

---

### 📉 **6. Shorten token TTL**

* Keep JWT `exp` (expiration) times reasonably short, especially when rotating more frequently.
* A good rule of thumb:

  * Rotate keys every 90 days → token TTL ≤ 1 hour
  * Rotate keys every 30 days → token TTL ≤ 15 minutes

This ensures that even if a key is compromised, its window of abuse is limited.

## 🔧 Realistic Rotation Policy Example

| Period | Action                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Day 0  | Generate new key pair                 |
| Day 1  | Add new key to JWKS; keep old key     |
| Day 7  | Start signing new tokens with new key |
| Day 14 | Remove old key from JWKS              |

## ❗ Summary

| Practice                            | Recommended            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Rotation frequency                  | Every 3–6 months       |
| Use `kid`                           | ✅ Yes                  |
| Grace period                        | 7–14 days              |
| Token expiration (`exp`)            | Short (15 min – 1h)    |
| Monitor and log verification issues | ✅ Yes                  |
| Automate rotation                   | ✅ Strongly recommended |
