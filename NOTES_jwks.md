**key rotation for JWKS** (JSON Web Key Sets) is critical for maintaining long-term security of your JWT infrastructure, but it needs to be balanced against availability and operational complexity.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for JWKS Key Rotation

### 🔄 **1. Rotate keys every 3–6 months**

* **Recommended frequency**: Every **90–180 days**.
* This balances security (in case of key compromise) with operational stability.

> ☑️ Large security-conscious organizations (Google, AWS, Azure) tend to rotate keys every **3 to 6 months**.

---

### 🔐 **2. Always use key IDs (`kid`)**

* Ensure each key in your JWKS has a unique `"kid"` (key ID).
* JWTs should include this `kid` so consumers can pick the correct key during verification.

```json
{
  "kid": "key-2025-09-01",
  "kty": "RSA",
  "use": "sig",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "n": "...",
  "e": "..."
}
```

---

### 🧠 **3. Implement a grace period**

* When rotating keys, **don’t immediately remove the old key**.
* Keep both the **new and old keys** in the JWKS endpoint for a **grace period** (e.g., **7–14 days**).
* This ensures existing JWTs signed with the old key can still be verified.

---

### 🚨 **4. Automate rotation**

* Use tools or scripts to:

  * Generate new keys
  * Promote a key to "current"
  * Mark old keys as "retiring"
  * Remove retired keys after the grace period

---

### 💡 **5. Monitor token validation failures**

* Add observability (logging, alerts) around:

  * Missing `kid`
  * No matching key in JWKS
  * Signature verification failures
* This helps catch issues during or after rotation.

---

### 📉 **6. Shorten token TTL**

* Keep JWT `exp` (expiration) times reasonably short, especially when rotating more frequently.
* A good rule of thumb:

  * Rotate keys every 90 days → token TTL ≤ 1 hour
  * Rotate keys every 30 days → token TTL ≤ 15 minutes

This ensures that even if a key is compromised, its window of abuse is limited.

## 🔧 Realistic Rotation Policy Example

| Period | Action                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Day 0  | Generate new key pair                 |
| Day 1  | Add new key to JWKS; keep old key     |
| Day 7  | Start signing new tokens with new key |
| Day 14 | Remove old key from JWKS              |

## ❗ Summary

| Practice                            | Recommended            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Rotation frequency                  | Every 3–6 months       |
| Use `kid`                           | ✅ Yes                  |
| Grace period                        | 7–14 days              |
| Token expiration (`exp`)            | Short (15 min – 1h)    |
| Monitor and log verification issues | ✅ Yes                  |
| Automate rotation                   | ✅ Strongly recommended |

The `JwtAuthority` class is now **even more secure**.

## ✅ Summary: Are You Secure Now?

> **Yes — you are doing all the right things** to prevent token forgery via public keys or header injection.

Let’s walk through it carefully to validate why you're safe:

---

## 🔐 Critical Security Checks: ✅ All Present

| Protection                           | Implemented                                                     | Why it matters                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Private key used to sign**         | ✅ Yes (`sign()` uses `#getPrivateKey`)                          | Ensures only your app can issue valid tokens.    |
| **Public key used to verify**        | ✅ Yes (`verify()` gets public key from trusted store)           | Ensures only your known keys are used to verify. |
| **Validates `alg === 'RS256'`**      | ✅ Yes (`verify()` line: `if (protectedHeader.alg !== 'RS256')`) | Prevents algorithm confusion attacks.            |
| **Rejects `jwk` in header**          | ✅ Yes (`if ('jwk' in protectedHeader) throw Error`)             | Prevents JWK injection attacks.                  |
| **Optional: checks `typ === 'JWT'`** | ✅ Yes (case-insensitive)                                        | Adds redundancy in format validation.            |
| **`kid` must match trusted store**   | ✅ Yes (`getPublicKey(kid)` only uses known public keys)         | Prevents spoofing by untrusted keys.             |

---

## 🔄 JWKS Rotation: Also Looks Secure

Your `JwksRotator`:

* Checks the last rotation timestamp.
* Calls `generateKeyPair()` to rotate keys.
* Stores new keys securely.

✅ This is well-designed and suitable for production use.

---

## 🛑 Can a Public Key Be Used to Forge a JWT?

> **No** — not in your system.

* A **public key** cannot generate a valid signature. That’s the entire point of asymmetric encryption (like RSA).
* Your app does **not allow arbitrary keys from token headers** (`jwk` is explicitly rejected).
* Your app only trusts keys in your internal `JwksKeyStore`, and these are **created and rotated** internally.

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

### ✔️ You're safe against:

* JWK injection
* Algorithm downgrade attacks (`alg: none`, `HS256`)
* Forged tokens signed with attacker-generated keys
* Malicious `typ` headers

---

## 🚀 Optional Next Steps (If you want to go even further)

Here are a few best-practice ideas you can optionally implement:

### 1. **Enforce JWT expiration and not-before claims (if present)**

```ts
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
if (payload.exp && now >= payload.exp) {
    throw new Error('Token expired')
}
if (payload.nbf && now < payload.nbf) {
    throw new Error('Token not yet valid')
}
```

### 2. **Add key usage constraints (kid whitelisting / key ID rotation logging)**

If you're rotating keys frequently, you might want to:

* Keep a small history of used `kid`s to detect replay attempts or misuse.
* Log unexpected or unknown `kid`s for alerting.

---

## ✅ TL;DR

Yes — your updated `JwtAuthority` is secure.

You're:

* Signing with private keys ✅
* Verifying with known public keys ✅
* Blocking `jwk` and invalid algorithms ✅

---

Yes — **your library implementation already covers the most critical security aspects** of JWT signing and verification. Here's a breakdown of where your responsibilities end and what falls on the developer using your library:

---

## ✅ What Your Library Already Secures

These are **core responsibilities** that the library must handle — and you **do**:

| Security Area                  | Covered? | Notes                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Private key signing only     | ✔️       | Only your code can generate valid tokens       |
| ✅ Public key verification only | ✔️       | Only keys from your `JwksKeyStore` are trusted |
| ✅ `kid` validation             | ✔️       | Prevents arbitrary key injection               |
| ✅ `alg` enforcement (`RS256`)  | ✔️       | Mitigates alg-confusion attacks                |
| ✅ Reject `jwk` in JWT header   | ✔️       | Prevents JWK header injection attacks          |
| ✅ `typ` sanity check           | ✔️       | Adds format validation                         |

This is **the minimum required for a secure and correct JWT authority**.

## 🛠️ What Developers Should Handle Themselves

There are some things that are **application-specific**, and you’re absolutely right to leave them to the dev:

| Responsibility                                                    | Why it’s app-level                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ❌ `exp`, `nbf`, `iat` validation                                  | You can’t assume token lifespan or clock drift margins |
| ❌ `aud`, `iss`, `sub`, etc. checks                                | These are domain-specific claims                       |
| ❌ Token revocation or `jti` replay protection                     | Usually depends on storage and business logic          |
| ❌ `scope` or `role` checks                                        | Authz is app-specific                                  |
| ❌ Business-level validation (user exists, machine ID valid, etc.) | Should be in the `validate()` callback in the builder  |

You’ve kept your library focused on **JWT trust establishment**, and delegated **authorization and domain validation** to the app developer — which is exactly the right separation of concerns.

## 🧠 Developer Expectations

If you're providing this as part of a framework or shared lib, you might want to document something like:

```markdown
### ⚠️ Developer Responsibilities

This library ensures JWTs are securely signed and verified.

However, application developers are responsible for:

- Validating `exp`, `nbf`, and `iat` claims
- Checking application-specific claims (`aud`, `iss`, `sub`, etc.)
- Enforcing access control based on `scope`, `role`, or permissions
- Implementing token revocation or replay prevention if needed
- Performing user or machine identity lookups as needed
```

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

> **Yes — you’ve nailed the most critical parts.**
> The surface area that’s left to developers is **appropriate, safe, and well-bounded**.
